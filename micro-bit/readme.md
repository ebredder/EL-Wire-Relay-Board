Examples to get started:

**RadioTestPin0.js** - Code to send information to another micro:bit. Each micro:bit can have the same firmware. This uses the radio to tell another micro:bit to turn on D0 for 1 second and turns it off. There is also scrolling text on the LED matrix for testing.

**RadioTestPin0.hex** - copy to your micro:bit when used as a mass storage device

**BlinkPin0.hex** - Test your circuit with standard blink operation on D0. Upload as mass storage.
